# Traffic-prediction-using-MNN

Project Abstract :-

Introduction :-
This code implements a machine learning model to predict traffic patterns using a
dataset stored in a CSV file.The necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas,
Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, are imported at the beginning of the code. The goal
of the model is to accurately forecast traffic volumes, which is a crucial task in
urban planning and transportation management. By leveraging the power of deep
learning, this model aims to provide reliable predictions and insights into traffic
behavior.

Description of the Project :-

This project uses a neural network-based approach to predict traffic volume
based on historical data from the Traffic Prediction Dataset. The dataset contains
hourly counts of vehicles at four junctions, along with date, time, and junction
information. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and
training a neural network model to predict traffic volume.

Algorithm and Methodologies :-

• The algorithm is a neural network-based approach to predict traffic volume.

• It takes in input features such as year, month, day, hour, and junction.

• The algorithm uses a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers, each
with 64 neurons. • The output layer has a single neuron that predicts the traffic
volume.

• The algorithm uses the Adam optimizer to minimize the mean squared error loss
function.

• The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for
training and 20% for testing.

• The algorithm is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 32.

• The model is evaluated using the test loss, mean squared error, mean absolute
error, and root mean squared error.

• The algorithm makes predictions on the test data and prints the results.

• The algorithm is a supervised learning approach that learns from the historical
traffic data to make predictions.

This project develops a neural network-based algorithm to predict traffic volume
at junctions, utilizing historical data on year, month, day, hour, and location. The
model is trained and evaluated on a dataset, achieving accurate predictions and
enablinginformed decision-making for traffic management and urban planning.
